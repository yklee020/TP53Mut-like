The Beat AML raw RNAseq count data and updated clinical data are available in vizome interactive portal (http://www.vizome.org/additional_figures_BeatAML.html & https://biodev.github.io/BeatAML2/). The TCGA LAML clinical data was obtained from Genomic Data Common (https://gdc.cancer.gov/about-data/publications/laml_2012) and preprocessed raw RNAseq count data were obtained from (Rahman M et al., Bioinformatics 2015).
